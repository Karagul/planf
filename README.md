# Plan F
Just some screenshots of my planning/budgetting system.

## Plan
The `Plan F` screenshot shows how we break down my (fortnightly) income into certain brackets for the future, short term savings and goals, and retirement, etc.

### Charts
I've also got some Highcharts in there to visualise some of the data, making it easier to digest.

## Savings
The system can calculate growth of a savings account base dont he interest rate, but I have not yet implemented compounding interest with regular installments. This means the graph here is a bit "flat" and dull, but it still offers some insight... I guess?

## Goals
My favourite feature is the ability for the system to calculate when we will achieve of short term financial goals, giving us a good idea as to when we will be able to afford things and how much we need to put away each paycheque. Nothing too complicated to calculate your self, but it makes for easier reading in this format versus a spreadsheet (IMHO.)

You can also see the tabular version of the savings section above this too.

## Statement
Finally I also have a feature that lets me import my statementy and it calculates it for me, putting everything into catergories and totalling up the money spent on each category. For example, multiple trips to the local cafe will total up the sum of all trips and make it nice and disgestable here. 

Pie cahrt coming soon.
