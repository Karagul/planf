#Plan F
Like many people before us, my wife and I wanted a way to track our financial situation and plan our future. After looking at a lot of the free and commercial offerings on the market, I wasn't satisfied. Being a programmer I felt I could write something that was more directly related to our needs and in the mean time, we could juts stick to our spreadsheet and paper. 

Overall, the goal is to develop a system which can:

1. Give us a dollar-by-dollar breakdown of our net worth;
1. Allow me to divide our income up into "buckets" and have those buckets visualised;
1. Give us the option of setting short and long term goals and have their achievement dates calculated;
1. Be configured to calculate the impact of surprise bills and expenses;
1. Work with a list of daily expenses, giving us an idea of our lifestyle's cost;

But it needs more than this, because the above features are likely present in a lot of software (I've not investigated every option.) Instead of simply crunching numbers for us, which is useful but doable in a spreadsheet, it needs to enforce a plan of action and a set of rules:

1. Ensure our savings account(s) have at least three months of expenses in them;
1. Focus on debt and clearing it before we spend on goals;
1. Make sure we're aiming to invest in a house and then clear the mortgage in a good time frame;
1. Ensure we're investing the future;
1. Be very simple and clear, allowing for anyone to read the report and understand it;

I believe these goals are worth my time and I'm hoping this project will be beneficial for my family and yours.
